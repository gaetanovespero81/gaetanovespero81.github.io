# Personal Portfolio – GitHub Pages

This repository hosts my personal technical portfolio, published via **GitHub Pages** at:

👉 https://gaetanovespero81.github.io

The site presents a concise overview of my experience in:

- CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
- Python-based tooling and quality gates
- Docker and multi-stage build pipelines
- AI-assisted code review using GitHub Models

## Structure

- `index.md` – main landing page rendered by GitHub Pages

No build tooling is required. GitHub Pages automatically publishes the content from the `main` branch.

## How to update

1. Edit `index.md` with new content (projects, sections, links).
2. Commit and push to `main`.
3. GitHub Pages will redeploy the site automatically.

This repository is intentionally minimal and focuses on content rather than custom theming.
